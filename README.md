# att-sample
This app contains two projects - two ways of displaying a table. 

from the terminal, go to the att-sample folder
type: python manage.py runserver

PROJECT ONE
In the browser, go to localhost:8000/projection
This will show you a table whose data is supplied by a function in views.py - it works.

PROJECT TWO: 
In the browser, go to localhost: 8000
This will show you a table whose data is supplied by the database - it works.

Unfortunately, I did not save my progress on GitHub.  I worked on the code in one sitting, saving it to my desktop as I went, and only remembered about GitHub towards the end.
